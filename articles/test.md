A First Level Header
====================

A Second Level Header
---------------------

Now is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of their country. This is just a
regular paragraph.

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy
dog's back.

### Phrase Emphasis ###

Markdown uses asterisks and underscores to indicate spans of emphasis.

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.

## Lists ##

Unordered (bulleted) lists use asterisks, pluses, and hyphens (`*`,
`+`, and `-`) as list markers. These three markers are
interchangable; this:

    *   Candy.
    *   Gum.
    *   Booze.

this:

    +   Candy.
    +   Gum.
    +   Booze.

and this:

    -   Candy.
    -   Gum.
    -   Booze.


Ordered (numbered) lists use regular numbers, followed by periods, as
list markers:

    1.  Red
    2.  Green
    3.  Blue


If you put blank lines between items, you'll get `<p>` tags for the
list item text. You can create multi-paragraph list items by indenting
the paragraphs by 4 spaces or 1 tab:

    *   A list item.
    
        With multiple paragraphs.

    *   Another item in the list.

### Links ###

Markdown supports two styles for creating links: *inline* and
*reference*. With both styles, you use square brackets to delimit the
text you want to turn into a link.

Inline-style links use parentheses immediately after the link text.
For example:

    This is an [example link](http://example.com/).

Reference-style links allow you to refer to your links by names, which
you define elsewhere in your document:

    I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
    [Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

    [1]: http://google.com/        "Google"
    [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
    [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"

The title attribute is optional. Link names may contain letters,
numbers and spaces, but are *not* case sensitive:

    I start my morning with a cup of coffee and
    [The New York Times][NY Times].

    [ny times]: http://www.nytimes.com/

### Images ###

Image syntax is very much like link syntax.

Inline (titles are optional):

    ![alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "Title")

Reference-style:

    ![alt text][id]

    [id]: /path/to/img.jpg "Title"

Both of the above examples produce the same output:

    <img src="/path/to/img.jpg" alt="alt text" title="Title" />



### Code ###

In a regular paragraph, you can create code span by wrapping text in
backtick quotes. Any ampersands (`&`) and angle brackets (`<` or
`>`) will automatically be translated into HTML entities. This makes
it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML example code:

    I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

    I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
    instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.
To specify an entire block of pre-formatted code, indent every line of
the block by 4 spaces or 1 tab. Just like with code spans, `&`, `<`,
and `>` characters will be escaped automatically.

Markdown:

    If you want your page to validate under XHTML 1.0 Strict,
    you've got to put paragraph tags in your blockquotes:

        <blockquote>
            <p>For example.</p>
        </blockquote>
